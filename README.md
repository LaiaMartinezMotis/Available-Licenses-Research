#### What is an IP (Intellectual Property)?
When we talk about IP, we refere to a group of legal rights that provide protections over the things people create or invent, such as literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names...

##### Importance of IP laws in video games
The main purpose of the IP laws is to protect developers and their creative work, from pirates and competitors who want to take tehir work and use it without any compensation.
IP rights are associated both with the tools used to develop games and the content included in a game.

##### Types of IP

In general there are two types of IP:
  - Formal IP
  - Informal IP
  
#### Ways to keep safe your own IP
##### Copyright
Copyright is considered the most important IP protection for most of game companies, because of its ease of use, power and versatility. 
Is the only type of IP, that can exist without a regsitration. As soon as plans are down or code is written, copyright is present. 

Even though registration is not necessary to invoke copyright, it is highliy recommended as it serves as proof of authorship and that the work existed at a given date, in case of a copyright dispute.


##### What can be protected with copyright?

* Written works: the scrips of the story, the conversations between the characters and the source code of the game.
* Video graphic works: the game grephics and in the so-called cut scenes.
* Works of musical compositions: all the sound design in the game. This includes the soundtracks and sound effects.
* Graphic works/ drawings: the sketches, conceptual art and other graphics designed for a game.

##### What rights are conferred by copyright?
It gives the holder the right to authorize others to reproduce a work or prevent them from doing so. 
We must keep in mind, that the major part of videogames are ordered by comapnyies and created either by their employees or by outsorced workers. In this cases, the authorship of the copyright depends on the contract and each individual case. 
In most cases, these rights belong to the company that ordered the work, but the acutal authors may benefit from some rights, which can go from simply be mentioned in the final work to allowing these authors to remove the work from the public, compensating the copyright owner. you

##### Trademark
We can define a trademark as the legal protection of a distinctive sing used in the the commerce to identifiy goods or/and sevices. This sign can be a word, sound, name, symbol, graphic, short phrase... A successful trademark is one that allows consumers to instantly recognize the company and its products when they see the mark.

##### Why are they important?
There are a lot of benefits that come along when you trademark your signs.

Trademark focuses on pushing information out in public in order to get brand recognition and association with a particular company. They are considerated, the second most important IP after copyright, since they can set a company and its games a apart from others in the mind of consumers.
Another important function of trademarks is to allow the consumers determine the quality of the goods or services, depending on the prestige or notoriety of the trademark.

As I said, owning a trademark allows you to build brand recognition because consumers associate your sign with your games, but most important, it's a way to protect customers from buying goods or services that aren’t what they expected.

That’s a problem that trademark law seeks to avoid.

##### Trandmark categories?
We divide trademarks in 5 diferent categories, depending of what you want to reflect with your mark.

* Fanciful (Strongest Protection): Unique made-up names with no meaning other that the meaning a company associates with them. These are the strongest trademarks you can get.
* Arbitraty (Strongest Protection): Consist of common words or terms used for something other that its literal meaning.
* Suggestive(Strong Protection): A suggestive mark does not immediately describe the products or its features, but may suggest or allude to them.
* Descriptive(Limited Protection): Marks thats describe a product, its characteristics, its elements or its qualities. People may be tempted to pick a brand name that descibes their company's game beacuse it will be easy for the costumers unerstant what the game is about, but that will allow the comptetidores to sell competing products with similar names.
* Generic(No Protection): The term generic is the opposite of trademark and a generic term can never be converted as a trademark.
