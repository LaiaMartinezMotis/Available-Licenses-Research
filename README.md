#### What is an IP (Intellectual Property)?
When we talk about IP, we refer to a group of legal rights that provide protections over the things people create or invent, such as literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names...

</p>

##### Importance of IP laws in video games

The main purpose of the IP laws is to protect developers and their creative work, from pirates and competitors who want to take their work and use it without any compensation.
IP rights are associated both with the tools used to develop games and the content included in a game.

Even though registration is not necessary to invoke copyright, it is highly recommended as it serves as proof of authorship and that the work existed at a given date, in case of a copyright dispute.


#### Ways to keep safe your own IP

##### Copyright
##### What is copyright?
Copyright is considered the most important IP protection for most of game companies, because of its ease of use, power and versatility. 
Is the only type of IP, that can exist without a registration. As soon as plans are down or code is written, copyright is present. 


##### What can be protected by copyright?

* Written works: the scrips of the story, the conversations between the characters and the source code of the game.
* Video graphic works: the game graphics and in the so-called cut scenes.
* Works of musical compositions: all the sound design in the game. This includes the soundtracks and sound effects.
* Graphic works/ drawings: the sketches, conceptual art and other graphics designed for a game.

 <p align="center">
<img src= "https://github.com/LaiaMartinezMotis/Available-Licenses-Research/blob/master/docs/Copyright-Symbol-Transparent-Images.png?raw=true" width="250" height="250">   
</p>

##### What rights are conferred by copyright?
It gives the holder the right to authorize others to reproduce a work or prevent them from doing so. 
We must keep in mind, that the major part of video games are ordered by companies and created either by their employees or by outsourced workers. In this cases, the authorship of the copyright depends on the contract and each individual case. 

In most cases, these rights belong to the company that ordered the work, but the actual authors may benefit from some rights, which can go from simply be mentioned in the final work of allowing these authors to remove the work from the public, compensating the copyright owner. 

Copyright protection grants you the following exclusive rights:

* Economic rights: guaranteeing you have control over your work and remuneration for its use through selling or licensing
* Moral rights: usually protecting your rights to claim authorship (right of attribution) and to refuse a modification of your work (right of integrity)

##### How long lasts copyright?
When you create an original literary, scientific and artistic work, such as poems, articles, films, songs or sculptures, you are protected by copyright. Nobody apart from you has the right to make the work public or reproduce it.
In EU countries, copyright protects your intellectual property until 70 years after your death, or 70 years after the death of the last surviving author in the case of a work of joint authorship.

##### How to obtain copyright protection?

If you create literary, scientific and artistic work, you automatically have copyright protection, which starts from the moment you create your work, so you don't need to go through any formal application process.

However, you may need to advise other people that you are the author of that work. You can attach a copyright notice to your work – such as the "all rights reserved" text, or the © symbol – together with the year the work was created.


##### Trademark
We can define a trademark as the legal protection of a distinctive sign used in the commerce to identify goods or/and services. This sign can be a word, sound, name, symbol, graphic, short phrase... A successful trademark is one that allows consumers to instantly recognize the company and its products when they see the mark.


##### Why are they important?
There are a lot of benefits that come along when you trademark your signs.

Trademark focuses on pushing information out in public in order to get brand recognition and association with a particular company. They are considered, the second most important IP after copyright, since they can set a company and its games a apart from others in the mind of consumers.

Another important function of trademarks is to allow the consumers to determine the quality of the goods or services, depending on the prestige or the notoriety of the trademark.

As I said, owning a trademark allows you to build a brand recognition because consumers associate your sign with your games, but most importantly, it's a way to protect customers from buying goods or services that aren’t what they expected.

That’s a problem that trademark law seeks to avoid.

</p>

##### Trandmark categories:
We divide trademarks in 5 diferent categories, depending of what you want to reflect with your mark.

* Fanciful (Strongest Protection): Unique made-up names with no meaning other that the meaning a company associates with them. These are the strongest trademarks you can get.

<p align="center">
<img src= "https://github.com/LaiaMartinezMotis/Available-Licenses-Research/blob/master/docs/fanciful%20trademark2.png?raw=true" width="300" height="250">        
    </p>

* Arbitraty (Strongest Protection): Consist of common words or terms used for something other that its literal meaning.

</p>

* Suggestive(Strong Protection): A suggestive mark does not immediately describe the products or its features, but may suggest or allude to them.


<p align="center">

  </p>


* Descriptive(Limited Protection): Marks thats describe a product, its characteristics, its elements or its qualities. People may be tempted to pick a brand name that descibes their company's game beacuse it will be easy for the costumers understand what the game is about, but that will allow the competitors to sell competing products with similar names.

<img src= "https://github.com/LaiaMartinezMotis/Available-Licenses-Research/blob/master/docs/descriptive%20trademark.jpg?raw=true" width="800" height="200">


* Generic(No Protection): The term generic is the opposite of trademark and a generic term can never be converted as a trademark.

  </p>

##### How long can you protect your trade mark for?

In most countries, trade mark protection lasts 10 years, starting from the date of your trademark application. You can then renew your trademark protection for 10 years each time, for as long as you like. When you own a trademark, you can sell it to someone else or give them permission to use it through a trademark licensing agreement.

##### How you register a trade mark?

* If you need protection in all EU countries, you should register your trademark with the [European Union Intellectual Property Rights Office (EUIPO)](https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/search-availability) 

* For international protection, in particular if you trade outside the EU, you can register your trademark with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

* If you need protection in USA countries, you should register your trademark in the [United States Patent and Trademark Office](http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&state=4807:g05972.1.1)

##### Patents
A patent protects new inventions and covers how things work, what they do, how they do it, what they are made of and how are they made, A patent gives you the ability to take legal action to try to stop others from copying, manufacturing, selling and importing your invention without your permissions.

Registering a patent gives you exclusive rights over your invention for a limited period, normally 20 years. Other people cannot make, use, offer for sale, sell or import a product or a process based on your patented invention. You can give someone else temporary permission to use the invention through a patent license agreement or sell the patent to someone else. You cannot renew a patent after it expires.

  </p>

##### What can I do with it?
Patents allow you to:
* Sell the invention and associated intellectual property rights.
* License the invention to someone else, but retain ownership and certain rights in the IP.
* Discuss the invention with others in order to set up a bussines based around the invention.

##### How you register a patent?

If you need protection in only one European country, you can register a patent at national level. Check which local patent office  to contact.
For European-wide protection, you can register a European patent with the European Patent Office (EPO). A European patent also needs to be validated by the national patent office in each country where protection is required. Depending on the country's law, you may have to provide translations or pay fees by a certain date.

##### Trade Secret
Trade secrets can be a company’s most valuable IP asset, differentiating it from its competitors.
It is generally defined as confidentially or closely held information which can take the form of unpatented inventions, formular, designs.... In other words, it is something a business would not want the competition to know.

<p align="center">

</p>

##### What Can Be a Trade Secret?
Any idea can be trade secretd as long as it is an idea that confers some business advantage and can be kept scret. Trade secret rights can extend to virtually any concrete information that grants a business advantage, such as formulae, data copilations, devices, process and costumers lists. 

Information protected by trade secrets can be strategic for the long-term, like recipes or chemical compounds, or for shorter periods, such as the results of a marketing study, a brand name, price and date of launching of a new product or the price offered in a bidding procedure.

Some advantages of trade secrets are that they have no registration cost and can be protected quickly. There is no registration fee for trade secrets, but its not fairy to say that their protection is free. Every company that has a trade secret, has to make a lot of efforts to keep all of these valuable information a secret.

##### How trade secret protection works?
The fact that you have a trade secret does not mean that you have exclusive rights over the information in question. If someone else develops the same information, he or she can use it freely.

However, you are protected against dishonest behaviour: for example, if someone accesses the documents related to your secret information without your authorisation, copies them for their personal use or gives them to someone else. You are also protected if someone breaches a non-disclosure agreement and makes the information available to someone else.

In situations of dishonest behaviour, you are entitled to damages and other remedies. For example, a court order can prohibit the use or further disclosure of the trade secret by the person who had acquired, used or disclosed the trade secret unlawfully.

#### Licensing IPs

##### What is an IP licensing agreement?
If you are the owner of an Intellectual Propierty (IP), you could grants rights of use to an other legal person. This is known as "licencing you IP". You could also generate revenue by selling it, which is know as "assigning" or "transferring" you IP.

##### Licensing out of your IP
This agreement occurs between an IP rights owner ("licensor"), and someone who is autthorised to use the rights ("licensee"). In exchange, you (the licensor) get paid for giving permissions, tipically in the form of "royalties" defined as percentage of the sales. 

As you are the owner, you can also set the limits of the use of the IP.
* Keep your right over the IP, which means that there is no transfer of ownership.
* Remain responsable for the maintenance of the IP rights concerned.

##### How do you establish a licensing agreement?
You should at least:
* Put the agreement in writing
* Clarify which IP rights exactly are concerned
* Communicate the starting date, and termination of the contract
* Negotiate and mention in the agreement the financial compensation to be paid by the licensee to the licensor
* State the exclusivity or non-exclusivity for the use of your IP
* Mention all the conditions for the use of your IP
* Define in which territories the licensee can use your IP

</p>

##### Assignments: Selling your patents, trademarks and other IP
Licensing is not the only thing you can do as an IP owner. You can tranfer the ownership of your IP rights by assigning/transferring it.
With an IP assigment, you transfer all the rights you initially possessed for the piece of intellectual property concerned.

When the IP assignment is finalised, you will have no further responsibility for that IP (such as paying renewal fees), nor will you benefit from any possible commercial success of the product or service concerned.

In addition, unless this is explicitly allowed in the assignment contract, you will not be able to further use the IP concerned (invention, trade mark, etc.), as long as it is protected.

##### How do you settle an IP assignment?
* Draft a written assignment, which you and the assignee must sign.
* Clearly specify and identify the IP that you want to transfer, for example indicating the registration number (if it is a registered IP).
* Negotiate and mention in the agreement the financial compensation to be paid by the assignee to you.
* Discuss possible warranties for specific details and include them in the agreement.
* Specify which law should be used to interpret the contract (for example, the law of your EU country) and the jurisdiction for any possible dispute settlement, whether an arbitration panel or a local court.
* Make sure you register the assignment at the relevant IP office if it is a legal requirement.

#### Free Software Licenses
##### What are they?
Is a form that grants the recipient of a piece of software, extensive rights to modify and redustribute that software. These actions are normally prohibited by copyright laws, but whoever owns the rights, usually.
Depending on which license ypu have choosed to use

##### Different types of Free Software Licenses
As part of my research, I have search for different types of FSL that could help you in your future developments.

GNU General Public License v3.0

To use this strong copyleft license you have to accept its conditions:
    * Source code must be made available when the software is distributed.
    * A copy of the license and copyright notice must be included with the software.
    * Modifications must be released under the same license when distributing the software. 
    * Changes made to the code must be documented.

                   
GPL gives the user permissions of:

   * This software and derivative may be used for commercial purposes.
   * Modification.
   * Distribution of original or modified (derivative) works.
   * To incorporate the work into something that has a more restrictive license.
   * Private freely use/modification of the software without distributing it.
   * Provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors
                   
As all free software licenses, there are some limitations on what can or cannot do, in this case:

   * GLP v3.0,  includes a limitation of Liability
   * GLP v3.0, explicitly states that it does NOT provide any warranty.
   
   <p align="center">

  </p>
  
  
MIT License

As a permissive license it puts very limited restirictions on reuse, and has an excellent license compatibility.
The user will be able to use MIT license if:
There are some conditions that the user must complete, in order to use the license: 

   * A copy of the license and a copyright notice must be included with the software. 
                   
MIT gives the user permissions of:

   * This software and derivative may be used for commercial purposes.
   * Modification
   * Distribution of compiled code and/or source.
   * To incorporate the work into something that has a more restrictive license.
   * Private freely use/modification of the software without distributing it

As all free software licenses, there are some limitations on what can or cannot do, in this case:

   * MIT includes a limitation of Liability
   * MIT, explicitly states that it does NOT provide any warranty.
                   
Another positive point of this license is that is also compatible with many copyleft licenses such as GNU General Public License (GPL); and it can be integrated into GPL software but not the only way around.

Apache License v2.0

Free Software License created by Apache Software Fundation, similar license to the MIT, very permissive and also it has limited restrictions.

There are some conditions that the user must complete, in order to use the license: 

   * A copy of the license and a copyright notice must be included with the software. 
   * Changes made to the code must be documented.
                   
Apache gives the user permissions of:

   * This software and derivative may be used for commercial purposes.
   * Modification.
   * Distribution of original or modified (derivative) works.
   * Patent use.
   * Private freely use/modification of the software without distributing it.
                   
As all free software licenses, there are some limitations on what can or cannot do, in this case:

   * Apache includes a limitation of Liability
   * Apache, explicit states that it does NOT grant trademark rights.
   * Apache, explicitly states that it does NOT provide any warranty.
