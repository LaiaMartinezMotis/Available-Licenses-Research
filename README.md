#### What is an IP (Intellectual Property)?
When we talk about IP, we refere to a group of legal rights that provide protections over the things people create or invent, such as literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names...

##### Importance of IP laws in video games
The main purpose of the IP laws is to protect developers and their creative work, from pirates and competitors who want to take tehir work and use it without any compensation.
IP rights are associated both with the tools used to develop games and the content included in a game.

##### Types of IP

In general there are two types of IP:
  - Formal IP
  - Informal IP
  
#### Ways to keep safe your own IP
##### Copyright
Copyright is considered the most important IP protection for most of game companies, because of its ease of use, power and versatility. 
Is the only type of IP, that can exist without a regsitration. As soon as plans are down or code is written, copyright is present. 

Even though registration is not necessary to invoke copyright, it is highliy recommended as it serves as proof of authorship and that the work existed at a given date, in case of a copyright dispute.


##### What can be protected with copyright?


##### What rights are conferred by copyright?
It gives the holder the right to authorize others to reproduce a work or prevent them from doing so. 
We must keep in mind, that the major part of videogames are ordered by comapnyies and created either by their employees or by outsorced workers. In this cases, the authorship of the copyright depends on the contract and each individual case. 
In most cases, these rights belong to the company that ordered the work, but the acutal authors may benefit from some rights, which can go from simply be mentioned in the final work to allowing these authors to remove the work from the public, compensating the copyright owner. you

##### Trademark

Trademark focuses on pushing information out in public. A successful trademark is one that allows consumers to instantly recognize the company and its products when they see the mark.
They are considerated, the second most important IP after copyright, since they can set a company and its games a apart from others in the mind of consumers.

##### What can be trademarked?
A Trademark can be a word, name, symbol, graphic or short phrase.
